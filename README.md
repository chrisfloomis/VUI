# Vantage Labs UI Screening Test
# by Chris Loomis
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Tested on 
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Google Chrome Version 80.0.3987.163
# Mozilla Firefox 75.0 (64-bit)
# Microsoft Internet Explorer Version 11.778.18362.0
# Microsoft Edge Version 81.0.416.58 (Official build) (64-bit)

# Requirements:
#     1 Must looks as close as possible to screen shots provided
#     2 Message, Contact, and FAQ tabs must work
#     3 Edit, Change Status, Merge, and Add to FAQ buttons cannot be created using a table
#     4 Ticket tabs must show the identical screens to Ticket 1 (X and Add New do not need to work)
#     5 BONUS: UI is responsive

# Internet Explorer does not display, will need work.
# All other tested browsers display.

# 1 I acknowledge some minor adjustments required to make it look even more like the screenshots.

# 2 The tabs work.

# 3 This was done.

# 4 Tabs work and place holders for functions for the X and Add New

# 5 UI is somewhat responsive, but requires more work at certain breakpoints.
